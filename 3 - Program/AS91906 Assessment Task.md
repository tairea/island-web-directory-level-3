### Complex Programming Techniques:
**Question 2:**  
Clearly describe at least two complex programming techniques you used in your program. Include code snippets or screenshots.

**Student Response:**  
> _Hint: Clearly describe each technique (e.g., creating a graphical user interface (GUI), reading/writing to persistent storage). Provide clear examples (screenshots or snippets of your code). Explain briefly why you chose these techniques._

### Clear and Documented Code:
**Question 3:**  
How did you ensure your code was clear and well-documented?

**Student Response:**  
> _Hint: Clearly describe how you followed coding conventions and structured your comments (e.g., meaningful variable names, organized commenting). Provide snippets clearly showing your comments and organized code structure._

_[Your response here]_

---

### Testing and Debugging:
**Question 4:**  
Describe clearly how you tested your program to ensure it functions correctly.

**Student Response:**  
> _Hint: Clearly outline specific tests performed (e.g., functionality checks, user input tests). Provide clear evidence like screenshots, test logs, or tables showing results._

## Merit Level Questions

### Organised Testing (Expected and Boundary Cases):
**Question 4:**  
Describe how you tested your program using expected cases and relevant boundary cases.

**Student Response:**  
> _Hint: Clearly describe what 'expected' cases and 'boundary' cases you tested (e.g., maximum or minimum inputs, edge cases). Provide clear examples of these tests with results (screenshots or documented notes)._

_[Your response here]_

---

### Code Documentation and Conventions:
**Question 5:**  
Explain how you effectively used programming conventions and clearly documented your code.

**Student Response:**  
> _Hint: Provide clear examples (code snippets) demonstrating your adherence to conventions (such as naming variables/functions, commenting). Clearly describe why following these conventions improved readability and maintainability._

_[Your response here]_

## Excellence Level Questions

### Program Flexibility and Robustness:
**Question 6:**  
Explain clearly how you made your program flexible and robust.

**Student Response:**  
> _Hint: Clearly describe how you made your program robust (e.g., input validation, error handling) and flexible (e.g., using constants, parameters). Include clear examples (screenshots or code snippets)._

_[Your response here]_

---

### Comprehensive Testing and Debugging:
**Question 7:**  
Clearly document your comprehensive testing strategy. Include evidence of testing expected, boundary, and invalid cases, and explain how this made your program robust.

**Student Response:**  
> _Hint: Provide detailed examples (test results, logs, screenshots) clearly showing comprehensive testing. Clearly discuss issues found and how they were resolved to improve program robustness._

_[Your response here]_

---

### Refined Program Structure:
**Question 8:**  
Clearly explain how you ensured your program was logically structured, robust, and responded effectively to the task.

**Student Response:**  
> _Hint: Clearly describe structural decisions (e.g., modularity, clear logic). Provide examples from your code showing clear, logical structures, robustness (handling errors, unexpected inputs), and flexibility (easy updates, scalability)._
